            <h2>DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior that seeks to control, coerce or exert power over a spouse, partner, girl/boyfriend or family member. Domestic violence includes physical, emotional, verbal, sexual, financial and structural abuse.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is a learned behavior and is not caused by alcohol or drug abuse, mental illness, anger management etc. These are just excuses and can often lead to further harmful stereotyping of people with mental illness.
                <br>
                <br>
                Domestic violence impacts people regardless of age, class, caste, gender or religion. It is inaccurate and harmful to classify domestic violence as something that happens in working class homes or due to a lack of education.
                <br>
                <br>
                People of all backgrounds face domestic violence. Response to help seeking behavior and access and resources available vary and this is an inequity that needs to be corrected by both institutions and civil society organizations.
                <br>
                <br>
                Women and queer individuals are disproportionately impacted by domestic violence and pay the price for it with a loss in access and mobility, education and career, mental and physical health. Queer individuals are exceptionally vulnerable to domestic violence due to a lack of acceptance of their identities by family, community and institutional structures which are all sites of violence against. <br><br></p>
